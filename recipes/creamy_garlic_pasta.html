    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My go-to recipe for pasta. It's quick, easy and tastes incredible.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pasta of your choosing (I prefer penne)</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Garlic powder</li>
      <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Heavy cream</li>
      <li>Oregano</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a saucepan halfway with water and set it over high heat. When it
        reaches a simmer, salt the water generously and add a drizzle of olive
        oil. Then, add pasta and cook according to package instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the pasta, reserving some of the water it was cooked in. Add pasta
        to a preheated pan, alongside crushed garlic and olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add reserved pasta water, heavy cream and cheese. Season with garlic
        powder and oregano, and reduce the heat. Serve once the sauce has
        thickened and coats the pasta.
      </li>
    </ol>
